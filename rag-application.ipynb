We may recognize\n","additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations,\n","administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and\n","accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of\n","jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online\n","commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes\n","\n","Chunk 147:\n","commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes\n","on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions\n","have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue\n","unless broader international tax reform is implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us\n","prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide\n","information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not\n","have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\n","Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new\n","businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to\n","\n","Chunk 148:\n","businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to\n","realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price,\n","changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In\n","the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is\n","required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.\n","We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or\n","other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for\n","prior and subsequent periods. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial,\n","administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations.\n","\n","Chunk 149:\n","administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations.\n","We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals.
